Rowling","book_edition":"Magic Edition","book_synopsis":"Harry Potter is furious that he is stuck at the Dursleys' house for the summer, when he suspects that Voldemort is gathering an army, and the wizarding authorities seem unwilling to do anything. Harry's so-called friends are trying to keep him in the dark. But he knows that Voldemort's forces can find him wherever he is; he could be attacked at any moment. Harry is finally rescued from Privet Drive by members of the Order of the Phoenix - a secret society first formed years ago to fight Voldemort - and discovers that maybe he is not alone in this battle after all. These new editions of the classic and internationally bestselling, multi-award-winning series feature instantly pick-up-able new jackets by Jonny Duddle, with huge child appeal, to bring Harry Potter to the next generation of readers. It's time to PASS THE MAGIC ON .","book_price":"25","book_parution":"2014-08-19","book_category":"Fiction","book_cover":"nopicture.png"},{"book_id":"d30668fc-f78b-4ce0-9579-fb590a093b8d","book_title":"ff","book_author":"ff","book_edition":"ff","book_synopsis":"ff","book_price":"75","book_parution":"2021-10-31","book_category":"Fantasy","book_cover":"nopicture.png"},{"book_id":"94014cd8-4a48-4823-b227-ad703b15a931","book_title":"dd","book_author":"dd","book_edition":"dd","book_synopsis":"dd","book_price":"75","book_parution":"2021-10-10","book_category":"Adventure","book_cover":"nopicture.png"}]
